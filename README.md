# Angular Bare Essentials for VS Code
This extension pack for Visual Studio Code adds a bare minimum of useful tools for Angular development.

Install [Angular Bare Essentials](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brain.angular-bare-essentials) now.

## Why make this fork?

This extension is a fork of the "[Angular Essentials](https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-angular-essentials)" by John Papa.

Some extensions in the Angular Essentials package is sometime a bit problematic, and they cannot be individually uninstalled or disabled when the pack is installed.

## What is removed from the original?

* **Debugger for Chrome**
This can sometimes make both Chrome and VS Code freeze and hang.

* **EditorConfig for VS Code**
Only supports a few properties of the .editorConfig, and using VS Code settings makes this obsolete.

* **Winter is Coming Theme**
The pack shouldn't include any theme.

* **Prettier - JavaScript formatter**
VS Code have extensive support for customizing formatting and this extension took over for the built-in formatting support in VS Code.
